# a_million_dollars
a game of what would you do if you won a million dollars.
from the home page you can see your account, what you own and options for different catagories to shop in. items have button to add to cart. cart shows items and total and hitting checkout updates your account and home page

after starting this project i'm quickly realizing every little step can be broken down into a bunch more steps and every one is a whole challenge by its self.

so everything seems easy to understand except im getting an error that i cant even begin to solve, maybe im not understanding this as much as i need to.

so while im working on the shopping cart i everything went from working great to errors that caused my main shop to dissapear. Ive been doing every check along the wat and can't figure out what happened so ive just been working on getting it back. i have an error spot that i don't know how it could be related and ive put a bunch of console.log everywhere to see what is getting acessed. no luck. but i'll keep working.
 i was giong to start moving some data around to get something to generate and i noticed this "working tree" a quick google search didnt answer why it was there but as soon as i save my work it went away and the shop was working like normal, about a half a second after ranting on here that i can't fix it.. i hate technology.

 i have a lot to do, i am just struggling to find the focus to do it. but i want to make the store fully fonctional and add a footer to make suggestions of what to add. and decide if i want the main page to have button links to each catagory or still have dropdown catagories. the drop down was the origional idea but after working on it, it might just be too messy to make.
