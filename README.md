# a_million_dollars
simulate what would you do if you won a million dollars.
the home page says you win what would you do? and shows your current account and what you own and a big button for shop. shop page has catagories that drop down and show each item, items have button to add to cart. cart shows items and total and hitting checkout updates your account and home page
quickly realizing every little step can be broken down into a bunch more steps and every one is a whole challenge by its self.

dropdown menue by click. 
drop down box shows buttons with name and price
click pushes the item to cart array. items should be written in js to move easily while still display right in the page.
maybe cereal numbers? html has all the pictures and stuff but when it goes to cart it just takes the cereal and goes from there?
